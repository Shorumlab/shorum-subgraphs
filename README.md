## Queries

Below are a few ways to show how to query the uniswap-subgraph for data. The queries show most of the information that is queryable, but there are many other filtering options that can be used, just check out the [querying api](https://thegraph.com/docs/graphql-api). These queries can be used locally or in The Graph Explorer playground.
