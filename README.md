# Shorum Subgraph

This subgraph dynamically tracks related protocol data.

Right now it is mainly to track the binding relationship between `profile id` and created `distributor` contract address. It is very important to get the distributor address so that the folowee or the others can send funds to reward the folowers.

Make sure to update package.json settings to point to your own graph account.
